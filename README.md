# DLX-Sudoku-Puzzle-Solver

Welcome to the DLX Sudoku Solver repository! This project is a comprehensive implementation of Donald Knuth's Dancing Links Algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles. It features a robust, menu-driven C++ application and a sleek, fully functional web-based solver.

## Introduction

This repository contains the DLX Sudoku Solver, an advanced Sudoku puzzle solver implementing Donald Knuth's Dancing Links Algorithm. This project not only allows for solving traditional Sudoku puzzles but also offers a unique, interactive experience through its web-based interface.

## Features

### Console Application: Run Source.cpp and follow the on-screen instructions to generate and solve Sudoku puzzles.

- Dancing Links Algorithm: Implemented in DancingLinks.h and DancingLinks.cpp for efficient puzzle solving.
- Menu-Driven Interface: Easy-to-navigate menu for generating and solving Sudoku puzzles.
- Random Puzzle Generation: Ability to create random, partially filled Sudoku grids.
- Multiple Solving Methods: Select from various backtracking methods to solve the puzzles.
- ASCII Puzzle Representation: Visualize Sudoku grids in ASCII format, both pre and post-solution.

### Web-Based Solver: Click on the link below, enter a Sudoku puzzle, and use the solve feature.

**Interactive Solver**: Enter Sudoku puzzles manually or paste pre-filled grids.
**Automatic Solution**: Solves puzzles instantly and indicates if no solution exists.
**Modern UI**: Aesthetically pleasing interface with intuitive design and responsive layout.
**Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Accessible through any modern web browser

## Getting Started

- For the console application:
  - A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- For the web-based solver:
  - Any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
